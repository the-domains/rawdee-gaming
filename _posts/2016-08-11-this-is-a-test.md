First of all, here's what my stream is about!

My love for Hands Up Dance music and PC Games, it's what you'll get and it's how I roll, if you do not like Hands Up Dance music, this is not your thing! ;-)

I love computer games! Huge fan, there now, I've said it. Also I might not look like a nerd, but I am and I'm proud of it.

I am born in 1984 and have had computers up through my childhood. I remember having a Commodore 64 and playing Bubble Bobble and Diana Sisters a LOT !

Not long after we got a pc with Windows 3.11 and 8MB RAM.... WOW !

On that my favorite game was the original Settlers: Serf City. Especially loved playing multiplayer with my dad on split screen. Fun fun ! :)
